\arguments{
\item{x}{Either SingleCellExperiment object containing a matrix of genes * cells required, or a matrix of log TPM values (also genes * cells).}

\item{y}{Vector of labels, which should have same length as number of columns in sce / x. Factor levels will be taken as the intended order for training.}

\item{y_labels}{Alternative ordering and/or subset of the labels in y. All labels must be present in y. Smoothing and scaling are done on the whole dataset, before any subsetting takes place.}

\item{assay_type}{If a SingleCellExperiment object is used as input, specifies which assay is to be used.}

\item{sel_genes}{Method to be used to select interesting genes to be used in psupertime. Must be a string, with permitted values 'hvg', 'all', 'tf_mouse', 'tf_human' and 'list', corresponding to: highly variable genes, all genes, transcription factors in mouse, transcription factors in human, and a user-selected list. If sel_genes='list', then the parameter gene_list must also be specified as input, containing the user-specified list of genes. sel_genes may alternatively be a list, itself, specifying the parameters to be used for selecting highly variable genes via scran, with names 'hvg_cutoff', 'bio_cutoff' (optionally also 'span').}

\item{gene_list}{If sel_genes is specified as 'list', gene_list specifies the list of user-specified genes.}

\item{scale}{Should the log expression data for each gene be scaled to have mean zero and SD 1? Having the same scale ensures that L1-penalization functions properly; typically you would only set this to FALSE if you have already done your own scaling.}

\item{smooth}{Should the data be smoothed over neighbours? This is done to denoise the data; if you already done your own denoising, set this to FALSE.}

\item{min_expression}{Cutoff for excluding genes based on non-zero expression in only a small proportion of cells; default is 1\% of cells.}

\item{penalization}{Method of selecting level of L1-penalization. 'best' uses the value of lambda giving the best cross-validation accuracy; '1se' corresponds to largest value of lambda within 1 standard error of the best. This increases sparsity with minimal increased error (and is the default).}

\item{method}{Statistical model used for ordinal logistic regression, one of 'proportional', 'forward' and 'backward', corresponding to cumulative proportional odds, forward continuation ratio and backward continuation ratio.}

\item{score}{Cross-validated accuracy to be used to select model. May take values 'x_entropy' (default), or 'class_error', corresponding to cross-entropy and classification error respectively. Cross-entropy is a smooth measure, while classification error is based on discrete labels and tends to be a bit 'lumpy'.}

\item{n_folds}{Number of folds to use for cross-validation; default is 5.}

\item{test_propn}{Proportion of data to hold out for testing, separate to the cross-validation; default is 0.1 (10\%).}

\item{lambdas}{User-specified sequence of lambda values. Should be in decreasing order.}

\item{max_iters}{Maximum number of iterations to run in glmnet.}

\item{seed}{Random seed for specifying cross-validation folds and test data}
